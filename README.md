# startup_TinDog
a mockup of a startup website called TinDog (Tinder for dogs) using Bootstrap

Disclaimer: 
The project comes from a Udemy course called "The Complete Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu.
At this point of the course, Î¹n order to combine our knowlegde about CSS Flexbox, Grid & Bootstrap, we created this mockup website of an imaginary startup.
